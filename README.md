# TheClueApp
Small iOS App to help a relative who can't really talk anymore but can still point and see. When we get the context of what this person is trying to say, it goes fast to understand her. This app is not a catch-all-universal-dictionnary.
Default words are provided but users must add theirs to adapt to the situation.
